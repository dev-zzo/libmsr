# libmsr: a library to handle MSRxxx devices

This was coded instead of using the library kindly provided by the vendor, with the aim of being a robust and easy to use piece of software.

**Project status**: active development. Please do use my library and let me know whether there are any other features you would like to have. Bug reports are also welcome.

**Implementation status**: fully working on a device I have.

**Tested devices**:

* MSR605

**Untested but should be working**:

* MSR206
* MSRE206
* MSR505
* MSR606
* Generally, any MSRxxx device with a similar command set

Please report your experience with these and other devices.
